# Bftsuite's Founding Misson
Welcone the collection of Byzantine fault tolerant repo. This repo will attempt to collect all (launched) blockchain projects, be it permissionless or permissioned, whose consensus algorithm adopts PBFT  or is inpsired by master piece PBFT. Issues and PR is welcomed.

## Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain Space Inspired by BFT, Especially PBFT

- Tendermint adopted by Cosmos Hub

> Note: First algorithm which combined pos mechanism sybil-resistant  attack and classical consensus progress. 

- Casper FFG adopted by Ethereum 2.0
- Mir-BFT potentially adopted by Hyperledger Fabric
- HotStuff and its variant(eg. LibraBFT)  adopted by Facebook's Libra
- Harmony BFT adopted by Harmony blockchain
- BA* adopted by Algorand blockchain
- Scalable BFT(abbr. SBFT)
- Dfinity's consensus
- IBFT adopted by Quorum

## Other Interactive protocol

- Grandpa adopted by Polkadot
- Raft adopted by Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 and Microsoft's CCF blockchain framework
- SCP adopted by Stellar blockchain
- PBFT adopted by Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, Zilliqa, AntFinancial's Blockchain, JD Chain and Microsoft's CCF blockchain framework
